# Network-Protocols-Course-Android-App-for-Beacon-Location-Detection

The project aims to develop an Android application that utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to 
connect to a beacon and detect its location. Similar to the concept of AirTag, the application will provide users with 
the ability to track and locate items equipped with Bluetooth beacons. The application will enhance user experience 
by providing real-time location updates and notifications when the beacon is within range.
